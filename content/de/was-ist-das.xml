            <paragraph>Tortilla is a simple content management framework for personal websites which operates mainly on XML/XSLT. Tortilla uses the
                PHP XML library, which is included in most Apache environments by standard.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Tortilla focuses on content, but in comparison to a complex and resource intense CMS, all tasks can be done with a text editor
                and ftp access.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Using Tortilla is similar to editing a page in HTML. The main difference is that Tortilla provides a content oriented structure
                which is then automatically rendered to HTML.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Tortilla requires you to use its predefined document structure. The basic unit is a page, which is then hierarchically
                subdivided into divisions and sections. Content elements like links and lists correspond more or less to typical HTML elements. The
                structure also allows to associate content elements with custom CSS classes.</paragraph>
